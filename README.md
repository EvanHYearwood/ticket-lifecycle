<h2>Phase 3: Demonstration</h2>

<h3>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h3>

<p>This phase demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a ticket within osTicket, from the moment it is created to its resolution. The focus is on showing how tickets are managed, prioritized, and resolved efficiently using osTicket’s help desk system.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ticket Lifecycle Stages: From Creation to Completion</strong>
    <p>We will walk through the different stages a ticket goes through once it is created until it is resolved and closed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intake:</strong> The initial step where a ticket is created by the user or an agent.</li>
      <li><strong>Assignment and Communication:</strong> The ticket is assigned to a department or agent, and communication with the user begins.</li>
      <li><strong>Working the Issue:</strong> The assigned agent works on resolving the issue or provides updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The problem is resolved, and the ticket is closed after verifying the solution with the user.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Prioritizing Tickets Based on Severity</strong>
    <p>Not all tickets are of the same importance. We will demonstrate how tickets are prioritized based on the severity of the issue to ensure critical problems are addressed promptly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7):</strong> For critical issues like the entire mobile or online banking system being down, this ticket is given the highest priority and assigned to the SysAdmins team.</li>
      <li><strong>Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7):</strong> Moderate issues like a broken Adobe installation needed by the accounting department.</li>
      <li><strong>Sev-B/C (2 hours, business hours):</strong> Less critical issues such as the CFO’s laptop running slowly, requiring attention within regular business hours.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Triaging Tickets: Identifying or Escalating Issues</strong>
    <p>In this step, we’ll show how tickets are evaluated to either solve the problem directly or escalate it to a higher level of support if needed.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Solving Problems and Closing Tickets</strong>
    <p>Finally, we’ll demonstrate how the problem is addressed, the solution is provided to the user, and the ticket is marked as closed once the issue is fully resolved.</p>
  </li>
